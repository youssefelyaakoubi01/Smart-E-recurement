About MeetElise
MeetElise is on a mission to revolutionize the housing industry, with the ultimate goal of making good housing more accessible.
Access to affordable housing isnâ€™t just a problem - itâ€™s a global crisis. An estimated seven million affordable and available rental homes are needed in just the US alone, and no amount of government spending or policy have proven to be effective solutions.
MeetElise uses machine learning to address the underlying cause preventing significant advancements in affordable housing: operational costs. By automating the leasing and management of apartment homes, weâ€™re creating a new, low cost operating model that allows for the development of new housing at scale.
Our first product is an AI leasing agent named Elise that converts 65% more prospective renters to residents than a human leasing agent. She answers questions and schedules tours 24/7 and is so human-like that renters say theyâ€™re â€œhere to meet Eliseâ€ when they show up for a tour.
MeetElise is well-funded by VCs, strategic real estate investors, and customers and was started by technical cofounders from MIT and the University of Cambridge.
Our small, courageous team is building the future we want to live in. A future where housing is affordable, powered by technology, and accessible to all.
About the role
MeetElise is growing quickly and youâ€™ll be using our data deriving insights that drive product strategy. You will work closely with the software development and automation teams, designing and building out the infrastructure for 24/7 service for our first million apartments and beyond. You will have a huge impact on a product used by thousands of people a day. We are a fully in-office company with a beautiful new office located at E 33rd Street and Park Ave.
What you'll do
Build our core conversational AI that automates the leasing process and helps our customers operate their apartment communities more efficiently.
Develop new features that increase value for our customers.
Design meaningful improvements to our ML Ops and data infrastructure
Propose meaningful improvements to our software architecture and design patterns.
Research and publish innovative approaches to conversational AI

About you
Weâ€™re looking for someone who
Is driven and excited to join a highly productive team composed of engineers and scientists at a fast-growing startup
Has 2+ years of coding experience in Python or another language
Has hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks such as Pytorch or TensorFlow
Has strong fundamentals in machine learning and statistics evidenced by a track record of independent quantitative research (academic or industry) or projects
Has Bachelor's or Master's degree in computer science or a related quantitative field
Willing to work in person at NYC headquarters with your team 4-5 days per week
Nice to haves include
PHD in quantitative discipline such as computer science, physics, or similar
Experience putting machine learning models into production
Experience with natural language processing, especially conversational AI
Linux/Unix experience
Familiarity with AWS or similar cloud provider
Why join
Impact. As a leader in a small team, you will have the opportunity to really move the needle on our growth.
Youâ€™ll be learning and shipping constantly.
Youâ€™ll be significantly changing how the housing industry works today with the ultimate goal of creating more housing opportunities.
Itâ€™s not often that you can get in on the ground floor of a funded startup thatâ€™s scaling. Every single day you will be challenged to identify how we can scale and execute on it. Youâ€™ll learn what works when you succeed and what doesnâ€™t when you fail. Either way, the rest of the team will be here to support you. Collectively, weâ€™ll be figuring out the path to serving millions of apartments.
Benefits
In addition to the growth and impact youâ€™ll have at MeetElise, we offer competitive salaries along with the following benefits:
Equity in the company in the form of stock options
Medical, Dental and Vision premiums covered at 100%
Fully paid parental leave
Commuter benefits
401k benefits
Monthly fitness stipend
Our brand new Midtown south office with an open floor plan, fully stocked kitchen, and company paid lunch
Fun company social events through our Elise and the City program
Unlimited vacation and paid holidays
We'll cover relocation packages from outside of the Greater NYC metro area - we'll make the move exciting, not painful.
